# 📧 Payment & Email Notification System - Complete Setup Guide

## 🎯 What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Payment Confirmation & Database Storage** ✅
- ✅ Payment data stored in `payment_records` table with user linkage
- ✅ Meeting requests linked to payments via `meeting_request_id`
- ✅ Payment verification with Razorpay signature validation
- ✅ Status tracking: `pending` → `created` → `success`

**Database Flow:**
```
Student Pays → payment_records created
             → meeting_requests.status = 'paid'
             → Both linked by meeting_request_id
```

### 2. **Email Notification System** ✅
- ✅ Nodemailer installed and configured
- ✅ Beautiful HTML email templates created
- ✅ Three email types implemented:
  - **Meeting Assignment Email** (Student)
  - **Meeting Assignment Email** (Teacher)
  - **Meeting Reminder** (1 hour before - structure ready)

### 3. **Admin Portal - Teacher Assignment** ✅
- ✅ Dedicated meeting management page at `/admin/meetings`
- ✅ Shows all paid meetings awaiting teacher assignment
- ✅ Teacher dropdown with all available teachers
- ✅ Meeting link input (Google Meet)
- ✅ Assign button triggers:
  - Database update
  - Email to student
  - Email to teacher
  - Success notification

### 4. **Backend API Updates** ✅
- ✅ `assignTeacherToMeeting()` enhanced with email sending
- ✅ Fetches student and teacher details
- ✅ Formats date and time properly
- ✅ Sends emails to both parties
- ✅ Graceful error handling (assignment succeeds even if email fails)
